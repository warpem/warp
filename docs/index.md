Warp corrects global and local motion in cryo-EM movies while maintaining intuitive
control over the physical model's complexity.

Warp corrects global and local motion in cryo-EM movies while maintaining intuitive
control over the physical model's complexity.

Use a Deep Learning-based model pre-trained on many SPA datasets to pick particles and
mask out artifacts accurately without any additional input. Or retrain it on your data
to achieve human-like accuracy.

Warp and M are also great tools for subtomogram averaging. Warp and M implement many
new algorithms that improve the quality of reconstructions from tilt series data.

Warp can talk to popular SPA tools like cryoSPARC and RELION – no clumsy conversion
scripts needed. Plug Warp's constantly updated stream of accurately picked particles
into one of them, and observe how your results improve with every new job completed.

Warp's user interface isn't a mere afterthought. It is designed to let you handle
thousands of micrographs with ease, and spot problems in data collection or processing
right when they occur – so you don't waste time at the microscope.
